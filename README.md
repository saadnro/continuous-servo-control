# continuous-servo-pot

Two simple codes to control the position of a continuous servo (with infinite rotations) using arduino and a potentiometer.

1) servo-test.ino
Use this code to check and take note of the middle point, where the servo stops.

2) servo-control.ino
Put the middle point value into the constant variable 'servoStop'.
