# continuous-servo-pot

Here you can control the position of a continous servo (infinite rotations) using arduino and a potentiometer.
There is two different codes: with servo-test.ino you can check and take note of the middle point (where the servo stops), 
than you have to use this value in the second code (servo-control.ino) to control it.
